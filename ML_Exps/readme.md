# ML_Exps
This folder contains different Machine Learning classifiers used in the development of the thesis. 

## CNN_Class.ipynb
A convolutional neural network based on TERL that has the task of classifying LTR retrotransposons into lineages

## Ensambling.py
A script containing a ensamble method to classify LTR retrotransposons

## MLclassifier_experiment1.py
Experiments done with different coding schemes (see [Coding Schemes folder](https://github.com/simonorozcoarias/MLinTEs/tree/master/CodingSchemes)), different pre-processing methods, and several ML classifier, using their default hyper-parameters. Also, a cross-validation was implemented to test the models.

## MLclassifier_experiment3.py
Experiments done with different coding schemes (see [Coding Schemes folder](https://github.com/simonorozcoarias/MLinTEs/tree/master/CodingSchemes)), different pre-processing methods, and several ML classifier, and tuning one hyper-parameter for algorithm. Also, a cross-validation was implemented to test the models.

## MLclassifier_experiment4.py
Experiments done with different coding schemes (see [Coding Schemes folder](https://github.com/simonorozcoarias/MLinTEs/tree/master/CodingSchemes)), different pre-processing methods, and several ML classifier, and tuning one hyper-parameter for algorithm. Also, a cross-validation was implemented to test the models. This script implemented a version of SVC for multiclass classification, called one vs rest.

## Scripts MLclassifier_experiment5.py, MLclassifier_experiment6.py, MLclassifier_experiment7.py, MLclassifier_experiment8.py, and MLclassifier_experiment9.py
These scripts are simple modifications to the MLclassifier_experiment4.py. Testing different configurations between coding schemes, and pre-processing methods.

## MLclassifier_experiment_identification.py
Experiments done with different coding schemes (see [Coding Schemes folder](https://github.com/simonorozcoarias/MLinTEs/tree/master/CodingSchemes)), different pre-processing methods, and several ML classifier, and tuning one hyper-parameter for algorithm. Also, a cross-validation was implemented to test the models. This script implemented a version of SVC for multiclass classification, called one vs rest.

## significant_difference.R
Script in R to calculate the statistical differences between databases used to traing different ML classifiers.
