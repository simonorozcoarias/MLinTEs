# DL_Exps folder
This folder contains different neural network architectures used in the development of the thesis. All the architectures are presented as Jupyter Notebooks to facilitate the re-utilization of them.

## Alvaro_FNN_Ident_Class.ipynb
A Fully connected neural network that has the task of classifying LTR retrotransposons into lineages and also into negative instances (other genomic features than LTR-RTs).

## Autoencoder_for_data_augmentation.ipynb
Autoenco
