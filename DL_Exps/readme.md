# DL_Exps folder
This folder contains different neural network architectures used in the development of the thesis. All the architectures are presented as Jupyter Notebooks to facilitate the re-utilization of them.

## CNN_Class.ipynb
A convolutional neural network based on TERL that has the task of classifying LTR retrotransposons into lineages

## DNNs_InpactorDB.ipynb
Neural networks used in the paper InpactorDB

## DeepTE_comparisons_1D_representations.ipynb
Experiments done with DeepTE architecture, a 1D convolutional network and training using the different DNA numerical representations in 1 dimention (see [Coding Schemes folder](https://github.com/simonorozcoarias/MLinTEs/tree/master/CodingSchemes). 

## Dimensional reduction tests.ipynb
Experiments done comparing an autoencoder network againts PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

## FNN_Ident_Class.ipynb
A Fully connected neural network that has the task of classifying LTR retrotransposons into lineages and also into negative instances (other genomic features than LTR-RTs).

## GBRAST_positional_kmers.ipynb
A experiment using the GBRASnet architecture using the positional k-mer representation of LTR retrotransposons.

## TERL_CNN_comparison_2D_representations.ipynb
Experiments done with TERL architecture, a 2D convolutional network and training using the different DNA numerical representations in 2 dimentions (see [Coding Schemes folder](https://github.com/simonorozcoarias/MLinTEs/tree/master/CodingSchemes). 

## TERL_CNN_one_hot_complementary.ipynb
Experiment using the one-hot complementary scheme, in 2 dimentions and the TERL architecture.

## TERL_CNN_positional_kmers.ipynb
Experiment using the positional k-mers scheme, in 2 dimentions and the TERL architecture.

## VGG19_positional_kmers.ipynb
Experiment using the center scheme, in 2 dimentions and the VGG19 architecture.

## VGG7_positional_kmers.ipynb
Experiment using the center scheme, in 2 dimentions and the VGG7 architecture.
